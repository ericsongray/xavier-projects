# Write a function to convert playback speeds into a duration
### Use this formula to write your function
```
The playback rate is the number of seconds of video per second of real time, i. 𝑅=𝑉/𝑇
. Rearranging that, you get 𝑇=𝑉/𝑅
, i.e. the amount of real time is equal to the length of video divided by the rate. So a 4 minute video at 1.5 rate takes 4/1.5=2.67
 minutes, or 2 minutes 40 seconds.
```
