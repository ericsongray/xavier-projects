## Write a function to convert playback speeds into a duration
### Use this formula to write your function
```
playback rate is number of seconds of video per second real time, i. 𝑅=𝑉/𝑇
Rearranging that, you get 𝑇=𝑉/𝑅
The amount of real time is equal to the length of video divided by the rate.
So a 4 minute video at 1.5 rate takes 4/1.5=2.67 minutes, or 2 minutes 40 seconds.
```
```
playback speeds = [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2]
```
